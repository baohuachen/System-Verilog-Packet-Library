This is a great ethernet lib for verification with systemverilog.
My bench is with UVM, it would be great if we can convert this pktlib into UVM. If nobody else has the bandwidth,
I might be able to do the conversion. Any comments?
By the way Sachin, we actually worked together in Marvell datacom, I integrated your MACsec/PTP IP into my chips.
